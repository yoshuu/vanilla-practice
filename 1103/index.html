  <h1>iOS Safari 15 Beta Issue â€“ URL Bar changing size on non-scroll events</h1>

  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>
    When a dev explicitly tells iOS Safari not to scroll the document for
    certain touch interactions, Safari still detects the user's finger dragging
    up/down and expands or collapses the redesigned URL bar. For many
    interactive experiences, this will be obnoxious and can even break things
    for end users.
  </p>

  <h2>Repro</h2>
  <p>
    The area above uses <code>touch-action: none;</code> to enable a custom drag
    interaction without triggering scrolling etc. Drag a finger up and down in
    the above area somewhat quickly, and the redesigned URL bar will often
    repeatedly expand and collapse. This happens even when there's a significant
    horizontal component to the finger's movement vector.
  </p>

  <h2>Expected Behavior</h2>
  <p>
    The URL bar should only expand/collapse on top-level document scrolling.
  </p>
  <p>
    Gestures on <code>touch-action: none;</code> surfaces, as well as situations
    where the user calls <code>event.preventDefault()</code> in a non-passive
    touchmove or pointermove listener should not cause the URL bar to
    expand/collapse.
  </p>

  <h2>Actual Behavior</h2>
  <p>
    While Safari does respect <code>touch-action</code> to some extent and
    prevents scrolling, it does not prevent the browser from expanding or
    collapsing the URL bar. Vertical swiping happening anywhere for any reason
    can trigger the state change.
  </p>

  <h2>Other Notes</h2>
  <p>
    There are more demos I could create showing real breaking issues, but they
    boil down to this core problem. E.g. The state change of the URL bar also
    changes the space available to fixed position elements. This can wreck havok
    with interactive modals. In the use case where an iframe is placed in a
    fixed position modal and has any scrolling or dragging features, the entire
    iframe is continuously resized. I have an embedded app where I'm using
    react-beautiful-dnd for drag/drop in a list, and the iframe resize events
    cancel the drag interaction. This completely breaks the app. User tries to
    drag item; url bar changes state; iframe resizes and dispatches resize
    event; drag is canceled.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm aware that Safari hijacks other drag gestures, e.g. swipe right/left
    from edges to navigate. Those are often annoying for interactive experiences
    as well, but at least the affected area is restricted. Here, swipes occuring
    anywhere on the page trigger the URL bar to change state.
